# YOLO Object Detection using cvzone

This Python script utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model from Ultralytics, along with the cvzone library, for real-time object detection on video frames captured by the computer's camera.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Install required libraries using the following:
  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python
  pip install cvzone
  pip install torch
  pip install numpy
  pip install torchvision
Usage
Make sure you have the required Python libraries installed.
Download the YOLO model weights file ("best.pt") and place it in the same directory as this script. You can find the weights file here.
Run the script, and a window will appear showing the video feed from your camera with object detection results overlaid.
Google Drive Dataset
To use your Google Drive as a dataset source, follow these steps:

Open the Colab notebook provided [[here][https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fKqnTzuA_wGMzEiFRN5T_BwBgTWXcvna#scrollTo=87JOCmVGWDBj]

Mount your Google Drive using the following code snippet:

python
Copy code
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
Upload your dataset to Google Drive. Ensure that your dataset is organized appropriately.

Update the code in the provided Colab notebook to point to your dataset location on Google Drive.

For example:

python
Copy code
dataset_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Your_Dataset_Folder'
Replace "Your_Dataset_Folder" with the actual folder name where your dataset is located.

Continue with the notebook's instructions to train your model using the provided dataset.

Note: Make sure to provide the correct path to your dataset in the Colab notebook and adjust any other necessary parameters for your specific use case.
